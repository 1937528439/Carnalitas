# Carnalitas v1.3

## New Features

### Body Part Traits

* Added character flags: `carn_seed_tits_big_1` through `carn_seed_tits_big_3` and so on for all the body part traits. If a historical character has these flags, or if a character is spawned with these flags, they will be force seeded with the corresponding trait if the body part trait game rule is active.

### Futanari

* Added character flag `carn_seed_futa` which functions similarly to body part trait character flags above.

### Miscellaneous

* Added possible doctrine parameters `naked_females_active` and `naked_males_active` to our is_naked_trigger overwrite. This effectively makes the framework compatible with Nudity Laws.
