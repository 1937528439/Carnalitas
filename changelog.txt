# Carnalitas v1.1

## Slavery System

* Added new traits: Chattel Slave (`slave`), Freedman/Freedwoman (`former_slave`)
* New overwrites prevent Chattel Slaves from being granted titles, or from leaving court.

## Sex Scene Flag Triggers

* Sex scene flags are now persistent through the carn_on_sex on_action, allowing modders to reference them in followup events. The syntax is `carn_sex_scene_was_vaginal = yes`, where `vaginal` can be replaced with any of the supported flags. This means that you can, for example, add an event to carn_on_sex that only triggers when the player has `bdsm` sex.
* `carn_on_vaginal_sex`, `carn_on_anal_sex`, and `carn_on_oral_sex` are now depreciated and no longer function.
