# How to contribute to the Carnalitas Framework

## You want to add a new feature or bugfix
In order to keep the development branch stable, you should not commit directly to it. Here is the workflow you should follow: 
### Create a new branch
If you are an official contributor to this project, **create a new branch** from the "developing" branch (you can do it from github or directly from your local git repository)
  > If you are not an official contributor, you can fork this project and work on your feature there
  - It is recommended to name your branch "**feature/concise-name-of-the-feature**" for a new feature or "**fix/concise-name-of-the-bugfix**" for a bugfix.
  - If your feature or bugfixe is related to an existing issue, you can add its number (ie. #42) to the branch name

### Work on your branch
You can now start working on your feature by pushing your modification to your feature branch.
  - Only add changes that are related to that feature

### Create a pull request
Once your feature is done, or at least stable and fuctionning (doesn't cause crashes or break existing stuff), you can **create a pull request** from your feature branch to the developement branch
  - Follow the template instructions
  - Add a reviewer to the pull request (cherisong and potentially another contributor who already worked on the code you are modifying)
  - Add the label "enhancement" and any other relevant label, like "visual" if you made some graphical modification
  - If your feature is related to an existing issue, please link it in the pull request (the option is also in the right-hand column)
