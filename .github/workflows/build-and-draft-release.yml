# This is the build script for the Carnalitas mod
# It creates the Carnalitas.mod file based on the descriptor.mod, and compresses it alongside the mod folder into a properly named archive
# It then create a draft release prefilled with the content of "changelog.txt" and installation instructions
# Note: All changes to files made by this script are done on a building environment hosted by github, not on the actual Carnalitas repository (except the draft release of course)
